Candidate is part of the Virgin Voter Collective, a New Zealand group who have the mission to encourage first time voters to participate in the democratic process.

Candidate is a Tinder like app where the user can read a series of policies and either agree or disagree with them. Their score will then be reflected to show how their views align with each politcal party by percentage.

The app was first launched in 2014. My job is to update it with new content and any other changes requested by the design team.

Technologies currently used are Javascript with Modernizr and Zepto frameworks along with php, mysql and Apache2
